# Max's Full-Stack Mastery Program

Welcome, future full-stack developer! Your journey to mastering software development starts here.

Hi, I'm Max. With over seven years of experience in full-stack development using technologies like Angular, React, [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), C#, and [Dart](https://dart.dev), I'm excited to share my knowledge with you. Besides being a developer, I run a [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@flutterexplained) channel where I share tutorials and insights into software development.

My goal is to guide you towards becoming a proficient Flutter developer and expand your overall software development skills. Together, we'll tackle design patterns, delve into Flutter, work on exciting projects, and have one-on-one chats to help elevate your development skills.

## Here's what you'll get:

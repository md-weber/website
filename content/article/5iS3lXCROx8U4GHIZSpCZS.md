  ## Awesome Flutter Packages


  The first Flutter Repository is created by [Robert Felker, aka
  Solido](https://github.com/Solido). You can find a great list of resources
  that contains a fantastic amount of knowledge about Flutter. It includes
  further Ressources like Content Creators, Videos, Tutorials and example
  Repositories. And the best part, thanks to over 268 contributors the project
  is still in active development and receives updates regularly. It follows a
  strict [“How to
  contribute”](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter/blob/master/contributing.md)
  – guideline makes sure to

  read it carefully before you add your next fantastic idea.

  You are a bit lost on your track to enlightenment with Flutter? Search no more
  the Flutter Roadmap got you covered.

  It contains all essential parts of Flutter Software Development that you could
  think. This package offered me a personal

  Learning path. Additionally, I was able to track your personal learning goals.
  The Main Contributor is Oleksandr Leuschenko,

  aka. olexale he also is the author of
  [arkit_flutter](https://github.com/olexale/arkit_flutter_plugin) that allows
  AR development with Flutter.


  ## The official Flutter Gallery

  The [Flutter Gallery](https://github.com/flutter/gallery/) is officially
  inside of the Flutter Teams Repository. The Gallery contains a lot of
  full-fledged app examples. You will find demo applications for eCommerce
  Applications, Financial Services, Travel application and E-Mail Client. Thanks
  to the code examples and the fantastic
  [website](https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/), I was able to convince friends and
  partners about Flutter.


  The Gallery is a fantastic start of your Flutter career and additionally
  helpful if you want to convince your friends, partners and clients on how
  great Flutter is. Last but not least, you can check out the whole repository
  and start it locally.

  [FilledStacks](https://www.filledstacks.com/) is a YouTuber and Content
  Creator around Flutter and Dart and has a great library of Tutorials that he
  supports with a [Blog](https://www.filledstacks.com/) and
  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/filledstacks) videos. I highly recommend
  you to check out his repository in which he shares many insights on how to
  implement various topics like Firebase Implementation, Mouse Hover, Location
  Services and State Management. FilledStacks was one of the first YouTuber I
  found, and that motivated me to stick with Flutter and learn more.

  If you need support in your Flutter Questions. Feel free to check out my
  [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/flutterexplained)

  or my [Mentorship Program](https://flutterexplained.gumroad.com/l/ydgtfV).

  Here I will explain to you on real live projects how to work with Flutter and
  how you will use things like state management,

  tooling and I will answer your questions.


  The best thing to keep in mind is that all of these repositories can also be
  supported by you. If you have additions to all of them, feel free to create a
  Pull Request and help the developers. All right, so that is my favourite
  packages when I started with Flutter, this is now again over two years ago.
  Because I want to keep up to date, it would be fantastic if you have more
  repositories that helped you along the way, please let me know in the comments
  below.

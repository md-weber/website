  I searched for a strongly typed language that shows me errors before I am
  falling for them. Now after one and a half year I can say that I transformed
  from an Angular 2+ engineer to a Flutter engineer and I even started my own
  Youtube Channel with the topic FlutterExplained.


  ## First steps

  I started by creating some smaller prototypes. Without knowing the Dart
  Language, I wanted to create my first web app, which I did with the help of
  [Chingu](https://dev.to/chingu). Chingu is a platform where you collaborate
  with other members of a community to create a new project.


  The first time I used Flutter I used it in a Web Project and developed the
  backend with [Aqueduct](https://aqueduct.io/). Aqueduct is a framework in
  Dart, with that you are able to create a scalable backend. That was a
  fantastic time, learning Heroku added some CI/CD with Github Actions and was
  able in two weeks to create a web journal full out of Flutter.


  It was far from perfect, but jeez I was so proud of it. I wrote
  [articles](./how-i-created-my-first-flutter-app) and showed it in the
  community, and they liked it very much. That gave me the drive to work harder
  on my Flutter skills. At the end of 2019, I finally quitted my Freelance
  contract and started working full time on Flutter.


  ## Starting with my Flutter Journey

  I wanted to enhance my Flutter knowledge, I completed a certificate on Udemy
  from the “The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart”. I was
  glad that I have done it, just to see all things once more together and
  understand more of the core concepts.


  After that, I tried to replenish my social media channels. My
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flutter_exp) activity was not existent and my
  old youtube channel with around 20 subscribers was not worth a lot.
  Additionally, I had some ideas in my mind that I wanted to realise. Creating a
  world travel companion and even an electric calculator (which is currently in
  Alpha). That was the start of my journey.


  First, I developed the electrical calculator to see if I can manage to create
  an app in one week, and well thanks to Flutter I did! There are some
  improvements that I have to do, but it will be released in the next weeks.
  Also, I started with my youtube channel and got till now 400 views on a
  “MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder” Video, which I used to create a better user
  experience in my app.


  This is super exciting and I am thrilled that it works like that. This
  motivates me to improve myself even further so that I can explain everyone,
  even better the pros and cons of Dart and Flutter Development.


  ## Advantages

  I have never learned that much in such a short amount of time. Also for the
  videos that I prepare, I have to continually improve myself. Learning to cut
  videos, add effects, creating better boilerplates, learning flutter details
  and dart packages. Additionally, my partner and me are working to setup up our
  own startup which takes time to prepare pitches and talk to investors.


  My [Github
  Profile](https://github.com/md-weber?tab=overview&from=2020-02-01&to=2020-02-10)
  explodes thanks to all the commits and if you compare it to 2014 when I draw
  little pictures in my timeline, it is a dramatic increase.


  ![GitHub Timeline
  2014](//images.ctfassets.net/573xlmlwok2s/2avPsApP3PLMj48y95n9if/d9562333782ac084119366fad10d5fc4/1-2.webp)

  ![GitHub Timeline

  Furthermore, I found a way into the flutter community and had the opportunity
  to talk with people who have the same interest as me. To be part of this new
  and interactive community is just amazing and the people encourage you to be a
  better developer in every aspect.


  ## Downsides


  Currently, I am living from my hard work of last year, and there are less till
  no projects for Flutter Development in Germany. So my clear goal to earn money
  with Flutter is to create my products, services and apps. Also, my Youtube
  Channel is one of my critical hopes for income. But there are a lot of
  barriers and if you think you can earn money with BuyMeACoffee … well, think
  again.


  ## Future perspective and Goals for 2020

  I still have to learn a lot about [BloC pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/),
  state management and advanced API handling with
  [built_value](https://pub.dev/packages/built_value) and
  [built_collection](https://pub.dev/packages/built_collection), but that does
  not keep me away from working further with this great technology.


  I would say there was never a technology stack that cared so much about the
  needs and desires of their developers. The users love the material design and
  flexibility. Designers see their creation coming alive in no time. The
  community seems to be still small but is one of the best groups I have ever
  worked with. All these things combined make me love Flutter.


  My goal for this year is to earn a living from Flutter development. The dream
  would be to go full time on youtube and earn my money as a flutter tutor and
  speaker. Additionally, I want to publish at least two apps this year.


  Thank you for reading so far, please feel free to share your journey with us.
  I would love to hear more about it.

## Repositories that are worth mentioning

The first Flutter Repository is created by [Robert Felker, aka
Solido](https://github.com/Solido). You can find a great list of resources
that contains a fantastic amount of knowledge about Flutter. It includes
further Ressources like Content Creators, Videos, Tutorials and example
Repositories. And the best part, thanks to over 268 contributors the project
is still in active development and receives updates regularly. It follows a
strict [“How to
contribute”](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter/blob/master/contributing.md)
– guideline makes sure to

read it carefully before you add your next fantastic idea.

It contains all essential parts of Flutter Software Development that you could
think. This package offered me a personal

Learning path. Additionally, I was able to track your personal learning goals.
The Main Contributor is Oleksandr Leuschenko,

[arkit_flutter](https://github.com/olexale/arkit_flutter_plugin) that allows
AR development with Flutter.

The [Flutter Gallery](https://github.com/flutter/gallery/) is officially
inside of the Flutter Teams Repository. The Gallery contains a lot of
full-fledged app examples. You will find demo applications for eCommerce
Applications, Financial Services, Travel application and E-Mail Client. Thanks
to the code examples and the fantastic
[website](https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/), I was able to convince friends and
partners about Flutter.

The Gallery is a fantastic start of your Flutter career and additionally
helpful if you want to convince your friends, partners and clients on how
great Flutter is. Last but not least, you can check out the whole repository
and start it locally.

Creator around Flutter and Dart and has a great library of Tutorials that he
supports with a [Blog](https://www.filledstacks.com/) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/filledstacks) videos. I highly recommend
you to check out his repository in which he shares many insights on how to
implement various topics like Firebase Implementation, Mouse Hover, Location
Services and State Management. FilledStacks was one of the first YouTuber I
found, and that motivated me to stick with Flutter and learn more.

      <title>Flutter Navigation – Everything you need to know</title>
      <link>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/flutter-navigation-everything-you-need-to-know/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Navigation is in every application a vital part, and the benefit of Flutter
is, that it already contains an excellent routing system built-in. The benefit
of a built-in routing system is a huge advantage that we have as flutter
developers. As always, we have to know about the hidden traps and understand
the tools so that we can decide for the best option for a given use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a good routing strategy, you have a lot fewer problems in the future, and
it also helps you to reduce boilerplate and maintenance cost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GitHub Actions - For a Flutter Developer</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-actions--can-i-eat-that&#34;&gt;GitHub Actions — Can I eat that?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no, but if you want to build, pack and deploy your app, it
is maybe something for you. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/features/actions&#34;&gt;Github
Actions&lt;/a&gt; is the CI / CD project from
GitHub. The CI / CD allows us to set up workflows for different scenarios of
our app. It gives us the possibility to build our app, test our application
and also to publish at the end our APK. The best thing is that you dont even
have to leave your GitHub page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Six Weeks with Chingu to feel like a Software Developer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2018 I started to realize my dream and learn how to code with
Udacity. I took a six-month Intro to Programming course and started to learn
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. At this time I had my full-time job in
Germany in Sales with my background of M.Sc in Industrial Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a tough time for me to focus on learning every day after eight hours
of work. Even if on weekends, I had to spend time to learn and submit my
exercises and projects. I was never in such a short time so often frustrated
and stuck in problems, like this six months. But I was never so amazed and
motivated to learn something, that I couldn’t give it up. After six hard
months, I managed to get my first certificate in programming from Udacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flutter Navigation – Everything you need to know</title>
      <link>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/flutter-navigation-everything-you-need-to-know/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Navigation is in every application a vital part, and the benefit of Flutter
is, that it already contains an excellent routing system built-in. The benefit
of a built-in routing system is a huge advantage that we have as flutter
developers. As always, we have to know about the hidden traps and understand
the tools so that we can decide for the best option for a given use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a good routing strategy, you have a lot fewer problems in the future, and
it also helps you to reduce boilerplate and maintenance cost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setup a Flutter Web Project on GitHub Pages</title>
      <link>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/setup-a-flutter-web-project-on-github-pages/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/setup-a-flutter-web-project-on-github-pages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To enable flutter web, you have to set up your Flutter CLI properly, and after
that, you have to make sure you are on the right channel. Today when I write
this post, Flutter web is still in beta, so we have to select a branch that
supports beta features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; flutter channel
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Flutter channels:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;* master
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; dev
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;* beta
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; stable
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master channel is the current tip of development. It contains the newest
changes in the framework but it is also vulnerable to breaking changes. So
that means in the worst case something is going wrong. The beta channel is a
code selection of the flutter team once a month to a branch that contains the
newest released features. It is selected and more stable. So if you want to
try around, this would be the channel to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I started with Flutter</title>
      <link>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/how-i-started-with-flutter/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/how-i-started-with-flutter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I searched for a strongly typed language that shows me errors before I am
falling for them. Now after one and a half year I can say that I transformed
from an Angular 2+ engineer to a Flutter engineer and I even started my own
Youtube Channel with the topic FlutterExplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-steps&#34;&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by creating some smaller prototypes. Without knowing the Dart
Language, I wanted to create my first web app, which I did with the help of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/chingu&#34;&gt;Chingu&lt;/a&gt;. Chingu is a platform where you collaborate
with other members of a community to create a new project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flutter Project - Scrum Poker App</title>
      <link>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/flutter-project-scrum-poker-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/flutter-project-scrum-poker-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I want to start by creating a clear picture of what we want to achieve.
I work currently on a Scrum Team, we always have to carry around our cards for
sprint poker. These cards are old, dirty and very often used from a lot of
teams and so I decided to change that with an app, once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scrum-poker-app&#34;&gt;Scrum Poker App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never worked in a Scrum Team before, you maybe never heard the
term Scrum Poker. To explain the whole idea, would probably be too much for
that story, but if you are interested &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ravindraprasad&#34;&gt;Ravindra
Prasad&lt;/a&gt; wrote an excellent
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ravindraelicherla.medium.com/story-point-estimation-and-planning-poker-3a0938a6b5ca&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
about that topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GitHub Actions - For a Flutter Developer</title>
      <link>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/github-actions-for-a-flutter-developer/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-actions--can-i-eat-that&#34;&gt;GitHub Actions — Can I eat that?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no, but if you want to build, pack and deploy your app, it
is maybe something for you. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/features/actions&#34;&gt;Github
Actions&lt;/a&gt; is the CI / CD project from
GitHub. The CI / CD allows us to set up workflows for different scenarios of
our app. It gives us the possibility to build our app, test our application
and also to publish at the end our APK. The best thing is that you dont even
have to leave your GitHub page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I go on a Chingu Journey, with Flutter, Dart and Aqueduct</title>
      <link>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/i-go-on-a-chingu-journey-with-flutter-dart-and-aqueduct/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;keywords:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Development
tags:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aqueduct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six months of travel, we decided to stay in New Zealand, and I got some
work as a software engineer very quickly. The work there is good with a lot of
friendly people around me. But currently, I am not happy anymore with Angular
as a technology stack. But to do private projects is quite hard, and somehow
the motivation is missing that pushes you to completion until my girlfriend
had an excellent idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Six Weeks with Chingu to feel like a Software Developer</title>

      <guid>https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/six-weeks-with-chingu-to-feel-like-a-software-developer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2018 I started to realize my dream and learn how to code with
Udacity. I took a six-month Intro to Programming course and started to learn
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. At this time I had my full-time job in
Germany in Sales with my background of M.Sc in Industrial Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a tough time for me to focus on learning every day after eight hours
of work. Even if on weekends, I had to spend time to learn and submit my
exercises and projects. I was never in such a short time so often frustrated
and stuck in problems, like this six months. But I was never so amazed and
motivated to learn something, that I couldn’t give it up. After six hard
months, I managed to get my first certificate in programming from Udacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I started with Flutter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I searched for a strongly typed language that shows me errors before I am
falling for them. Now after one and a half year I can say that I transformed
from an Angular 2+ engineer to a Flutter engineer and I even started my own
Youtube Channel with the topic FlutterExplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-steps&#34;&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by creating some smaller prototypes. Without knowing the Dart
Language, I wanted to create my first web app, which I did with the help of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/chingu&#34;&gt;Chingu&lt;/a&gt;. Chingu is a platform where you collaborate
with other members of a community to create a new project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I go on a Chingu Journey, with Flutter, Dart and Aqueduct</title>

&lt;li&gt;Flutter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Development
tags:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aqueduct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six months of travel, we decided to stay in New Zealand, and I got some
work as a software engineer very quickly. The work there is good with a lot of
friendly people around me. But currently, I am not happy anymore with Angular
as a technology stack. But to do private projects is quite hard, and somehow
the motivation is missing that pushes you to completion until my girlfriend
had an excellent idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Six Weeks with Chingu to feel like a Software Developer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2018 I started to realize my dream and learn how to code with
Udacity. I took a six-month Intro to Programming course and started to learn
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. At this time I had my full-time job in
Germany in Sales with my background of M.Sc in Industrial Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a tough time for me to focus on learning every day after eight hours
of work. Even if on weekends, I had to spend time to learn and submit my
exercises and projects. I was never in such a short time so often frustrated
and stuck in problems, like this six months. But I was never so amazed and
motivated to learn something, that I couldnâ€™t give it up. After six hard
months, I managed to get my first certificate in programming from Udacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

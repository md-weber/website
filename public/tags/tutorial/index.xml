      <title>Flutter Project - Scrum Poker App</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I want to start by creating a clear picture of what we want to achieve.
I work currently on a Scrum Team, we always have to carry around our cards for
sprint poker. These cards are old, dirty and very often used from a lot of
teams and so I decided to change that with an app, once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scrum-poker-app&#34;&gt;Scrum Poker App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never worked in a Scrum Team before, you maybe never heard the
term Scrum Poker. To explain the whole idea, would probably be too much for
that story, but if you are interested &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ravindraprasad&#34;&gt;Ravindra
Prasad&lt;/a&gt; wrote an excellent
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ravindraelicherla.medium.com/story-point-estimation-and-planning-poker-3a0938a6b5ca&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
about that topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

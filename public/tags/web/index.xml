      <description>&lt;p&gt;Navigation is in every application a vital part, and the benefit of Flutter
is, that it already contains an excellent routing system built-in. The benefit
of a built-in routing system is a huge advantage that we have as flutter
developers. As always, we have to know about the hidden traps and understand
the tools so that we can decide for the best option for a given use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a good routing strategy, you have a lot fewer problems in the future, and
it also helps you to reduce boilerplate and maintenance cost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I started with Flutter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I searched for a strongly typed language that shows me errors before I am
falling for them. Now after one and a half year I can say that I transformed
from an Angular 2+ engineer to a Flutter engineer and I even started my own
Youtube Channel with the topic FlutterExplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-steps&#34;&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by creating some smaller prototypes. Without knowing the Dart
Language, I wanted to create my first web app, which I did with the help of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/chingu&#34;&gt;Chingu&lt;/a&gt;. Chingu is a platform where you collaborate
with other members of a community to create a new project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;keywords:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Development
tags:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aqueduct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six months of travel, we decided to stay in New Zealand, and I got some
work as a software engineer very quickly. The work there is good with a lot of
friendly people around me. But currently, I am not happy anymore with Angular
as a technology stack. But to do private projects is quite hard, and somehow
the motivation is missing that pushes you to completion until my girlfriend
had an excellent idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Flutter channels:

* master
 dev
* beta
 stable
The master channel is the current tip of development. It contains the newest
changes in the framework but it is also vulnerable to breaking changes. So
that means in the worst case something is going wrong. The beta channel is a
code selection of the flutter team once a month to a branch that contains the
newest released features. It is selected and more stable. So if you want to
try around, this would be the channel to go."><meta name=author content="Max Weber"><link rel=canonical href=https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/setup-a-flutter-web-project-on-github-pages/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://flutter-explained.dev/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://flutter-explained.dev/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://flutter-explained.dev/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://flutter-explained.dev/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://flutter-explained.dev/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/setup-a-flutter-web-project-on-github-pages/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://flutter-explained.dev/posts/setup-a-flutter-web-project-on-github-pages/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Max Weber - Developer, Publisher and Father"><meta property="og:title" content="Setup a Flutter Web Project on GitHub Pages"><meta property="og:description" content="To enable flutter web, you have to set up your Flutter CLI properly, and after that, you have to make sure you are on the right channel.
